# neobux-bot

To support newer version of chrome, it will require windows 7/8/10 to be installed and running on your computer, linux and macos gets an error.
With neobux-bot, you just type an captcha to login if it's required and, you can now finally have a relaxed vacation while neobux-bot clicks the ads for you!
Since there's no Public API for neobux, you need to keep chrome opened until neobux-bot finishes to click all ads and closes the browser.

# Installation

1. [x] Install Selenium package by ```pip install selenium``` or ```pip3 install selenium```. (If first run automatically installs selenium if it's not installed then it will skip 1.)
2. [x] Create your account file with username and password variables.

Well Done!

# Usage

1. Start the program with ```python neobot.py``` or ```python3 neobot.py```.
2. After you start the neobot.py, you need to enter CAPTCHA manually and PRESS SEND button.
